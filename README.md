•	Explain what Git is and how it differs from GitHub.
Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
•	Describe the purpose of version control in software development.
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.
•	Briefly explain the basic concepts of Git (e.g., repositories, commits, branches, pull requests, and merging).
Repository: A Git repository contains all project files and their history. It can be local (on your machine) or remote (on a server or GitHub).
Commit: A commit represents a snapshot of changes in the repository. It’s akin to a save point in the project’s history.
Branch: Branches allow multiple lines of development. The main or master branch typically contains the stable version of the project, while other branches are used for features, bug fixes, or experiments.
Pull: Pulling fetches changes from a remote repository and integrates them into your local branch.
Merge: Merging integrates changes from one branch into another, often used to combine feature branches into the main branch.
